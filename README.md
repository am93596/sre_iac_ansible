# Infrastructure As Code (IAC) with Ansible

## What is IAC?
IAC means managing your IT infrastructure using provisioning scripts instead of carrying out the tasks manually. For example, launching an EC2 instance involves a lot of manual handling (clicks, etc) - a script of instructions could be written to carry this out for you.

## What is Ansible?
Ansible is an open-source configuration management tool. It is used for automating IT configuration tasks, such as launching and provisioning an EC2 instance

## What are the benefits of Ansible?


# Ansible controller and agent nodes set up guide
- Clone this repo and run `vagrant up`

### Please ensure to refer back to your vagrant documentation

- **You may need to reinstall plugins or dependencies required depending on the OS you are using.**
